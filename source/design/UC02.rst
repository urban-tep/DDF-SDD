Conduct on-demand processing
============================

1)  User registers via portal.
2)  User selects existing service in catalogue or store and defines for which area and/or time the service should be applied in order to generate a new product.
3)  User defines appropriate parameter setting (e.g., thresholds) functions of service.
4)  Portal/platform sends corresponding request to the processing center where the requested service and data access functionality are hosted.
5)  Processing center generates the new product.
6)  New product is submitted to information system at platform, where the user can visualise the result and decide if chosen parameter setting was sufficient.
7)  If selected parameter setting was not sufficient, user can modify settings and start new processing.
8)  If selected parameter setting was sufficient, the new product is delivered to the user via the portal/platform and the new product is registered in the catalogue/store.
