Conduct on-demand processing
============================

This use case aims at using TEP Urban for submitting processing on demand driven by the Area of interest search or the data selection


On demand data processing from portal
-------------------------------------

Some dataset can be asked on demand by the user to the production center.

Next figure depicts the sequence that consists of requesting a processing on demand based on a previous dataset selection as described in :ref:`design_uc01_dds`.

There are two types of processing mode that are supported by the processing centers that are configurable by an attribute field ``status`` in WPS execute requests. 
These two modes are **synchronous** and **asynchronous**, as displayed in the sequence diagram above. 

In **synchronous** mode, when an execute request is received from the Portal, WPS creates a job request based on the information provided in the execute request. 
The job request is then sent to Production Control. Subsequently, the job request is propagated to Scheduler while at the same time a monitoring thread is created at Production Control to monitor the job progress.
The job request is now in the Scheduler queue. When a resource has become available, the request is then sent to the specific processor, as indicated in the execute request. 
When the processing job is finished, the staging job is started. During the processing and staging, the monitoring thread of Production Control actively inquires the status of the job in a pre-configured time interval.
When the staging job has been completed, product URL(s) and metadata information are returned to the Production Control. The product URL(s) is sent to WPS, and eventually to the Portal (wrapped in a WPS response XML). 
The metadata is processed and sent to Catalogue. More details on the product registration to catalogue can be found here :ref:`product_to_catalogue`. It is worth mentioning that the WPS session is alive as long as the
job is still ongoing. The session is killed after an indication from the Processor or Staging that the job has been completed (successfully or unsuccessfully) has been received.

In **asynchronous** mode, the initial procedure is the same as the synchronous up to the job submission to the Scheduler. While nothing is returned back to the WPS in synchronous mode, a job ID is returned back to WPS and eventually to the Portal in asynchronous mode. The WPS session terminates right after this. What happens between Production Control, Scheduler, Processor, and Staging are identical to the one in synchronous mode, but the main difference is that Portal can now inquire the status of a job at anytime, given the job ID. Each call (GetStatus) is represented by a short session with an almost immediate response back to the Portal. As it is in the synchronous mode, product URL(s) is returned to the Portal once the job has been completed. In this mode, a single WPS client can submit as many job requests as possible regardless the status of the previous jobs are. That is not the case in the synchronous mode.

Product registration to catalogue
----------------------------------
   
.. uml::
  :caption: Product registration to catalogue
  :align: center
  
  participant "Staging"
  participant "Production Control" as PC
  participant "Catalogue"
  
  activate PC
  Staging -> PC : product URL(s) and metadata
  PC -> PC : collect and format metadata
  PC -> PC : instantiate catalogue client
  activate PC #Green
  PC -> Catalogue : send product metadata
  activate Catalogue
  Catalogue -> PC : metadata accepted
  deactivate Catalogue
  deactivate PC
  
The registration of product(s) to Catalogue occurs after a process has been successfully performed and its product(s) has been successfully staged. 
Production Control collects the metadata and formats it according to the Catalogue specification. A catalogue client is then instantiated to send the formatted metadata information to the Catalogue server. 
A confirmation that metadata information has been successfully accepted is returned to the Production Control.
