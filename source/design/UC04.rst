Combine, Analyse and Visualise Data, Products and Results
=========================================================

In this user scenario, a previous user data selection may be enhanced using GIS tools.

It is then assumed the user has made a data selection within a data package as described in :ref:`design_uc01`.

Preparation of data for PUMA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The process of visualization of the data inside the PUMA consists of three parts. First part is uploading the data into
the PUMA. Second is mapping uploaded data to visualization concepts available to the user in the PUMA visualization
interface. Third is either redirecting user to the PUMA visualization interface or integrating it into current state for
example via iframe. As a part of the third step it is necessary to allow specification of visible part of the interface
in the PUMA.

For the first part there is already available interface in the GeoServer component of the PUMA. This step consists of
creating a data store using GeoServer REST API

- http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/rest/api/datastores.html. This supports shp, properties, h2, spatialite and appschema.
- http://docs.geoserver.org/stable/en/user/rest/api/coveragestores.html. This supports geotiff, worldimage and imagemosaic.

If we need to support additional formats we will need to decide how to integrate them further down the line. It is
possible to support postGIS database by allowing access to a database, which will be mapped in the GeoServer upfront
manually. For other formats there will be some development effort needed.

For the second step we will need to expose the API, which allows the Portal to map the data to the visualization
concepts used inside of the PUMA. This is currently done manually in the GUI. To allow this we need to expose API for
this mapping. This needs to be done as a part of the development phase.

For the third step we will need to prepare and document the URL structure, which will contain the information about the
User Interface, its state and the visualizations which will be visible by default for the user.

Capabilities of PUMA with respect to visualization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PUMA focuses on showing the visualized data in right contexts. Second important part is to visualize them using tools
which will be accessible to as many people as possible. This is achieved by the combination of layers with charts
overlayed on top of the map.

In PUMA it is possible to overlay multiple layers on top of each other to get more complex image of the whole situation.
It is also possible to filter all the available information based on the Area of interest, Attributes, Scope and Layers.
In order to deliver maximum possible value it also allows user to see charts depicting the changes of the values over the
time.

4)  Portal/platform sends corresponding request to information system at platform or outside the platform (PUMA), where the user can visualise the result and explore the results in pre-prepared views.

5)  If computing-intensive processing required, the requested product is processed at a processing center where the requested service and data access functionality are hosted.

11)  If a new product is generated it can be registered in the catalogue/store.
