.. _design_uc03 :

Develop and deploy a new service and/or new product
===================================================

This scenario aims at using TEP Urban for user development and integration of a new service within the platform to expose it as a processing service available in the thematic applications for its community or other users of the platform.

Data discorvery and selection have already described in the previous section :ref:`design_uc01`.


Development environment instantation
------------------------------------

When a user wants to develop and integrate a new service, the development environment proposed in Urban TEP is the Sandbox.

The next figure describes the sequence of operations for an expert user to provision the Sandbox.

  **BC** and **IT4I** please review the text with the name and the ref of the devel env. I called it Sandbox for the moment

Developing and integrating a new processing service
---------------------------------------------------

4)  TEP Urban platform team checks, ingests and deploys new software and new data.

5)  User and TEP Urban platform team test the functionality of the application.

Deploying a new service
-----------------------


6)  As soon as operational functionality of the application is verified, the new service and new data sets are registered in the catalogue/store.

Using the new service in the portal
-----------------------------------

After those operations, a :ref:`class_terradue_1_1_tep_1_1_thematic_application` with the new service is available to the expert user. Then according to the authorization option applied, the user may share this application with selected users or its community (user group). The Content authority manager may also validate this thematic application with the new service and decide to make it available publicly on the portal.
