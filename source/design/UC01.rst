Query and access existing thematic content
==========================================


This use case aims at using TEP Urban for user exploration of the registered thematic data collection, visualize, share and download them.

The first step for the user is to discover and search dataset in collections within thematic applications.

The following first figure depicts this step using the integrated geobrowser of the portal and the basic visualization functions.

.. uml::
  :caption: Data discovery, query, visualization and selection on portal geobrowser


  actor "User" as U
  participant "Portal" as P
  database "Portal database" as PDB
  database "Catalogue" as C
  participant "Feature Server" as FS
  
  autonumber
  
  U -> P : Query Thematic Application
  activate P
  P <-> PDB : Load Thematic Applications items
  PDB -> P : Data Collections, Services, Maps, Features...
  P -> U : Thematic Application
  deactivate P

  U -> P : Query Collection with params (AOI, timespan, filters...)
  activate P
  P -> C : Query catalogue index of the collection
  C -> P : Datasets metadata (atom, geojson...)
  P -> FS : Get visualization features (WMS, WFS, TMS...)
  FS -> P : return features
  P -> U : Datasets information and visualization features
  deactivate P


Next figure depicts the next step that consists of selecting and saving a dataset selection. Then download or share the full selection.

  actor "User" as U
  participant "Portal" as P
  database "Portal database" as PDB
  database "Catalogue" as C
  participant "Feature Server" as FS
  participant "Data Gateway" as DG
  database "Data Provider" as DP

  U -> P : Select datasets in the basket
  U -> P : Save basket as a data package
  activate P
  P <-> PDB : Save user data package
  P -> U : Data package
  deactivate P

  U -> P : Download data package
  P -> U : redirect to DG
  U -> DG : download data package
  activate DG
  DG <-> P : query data package
  DG <-> C : query the possible locations
  DG -> DG : resolve the best locations
  DG -> U : download links (direct, metalink)
  deactivate DG



Next figure depicts the same use case but using PUMA for the data vizualisation and manipulation.

  actor "User" as U
  participant "Portal" as P
  database "Portal database" as PDB
  database "PUMA" as PUMA
  participant "Feature Server" as FS
  participant "Data Gateway" as DG
  database "Data Provider" as DP
  
  

Next figure depicts the next step that consists of subsetting and downloading only the AOI of the dataset selection.
