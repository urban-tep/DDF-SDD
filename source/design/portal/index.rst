Portal
======

The portal is mainly composed of 

- a Web Server running a .NET application including the components :ref:`group___core`, :ref:`group___security`, :ref:`group___tep`, :ref:`group___web_services`, 
- a web site of html and javascript in the component :ref:`group___urban_site`

The backend relies on a relational databse to store persistently the portal and user data.

The following diagram describes the components interactions.
