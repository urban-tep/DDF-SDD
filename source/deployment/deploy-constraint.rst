Deployment Constraints
======================

The Deployment Constraints captures the Thematic Exploitation Platform 
deployment related contraints.

The Deployment Constraints are partitioned into the Infrastructure Constraints for every subsystems and
Interaction Constraints.

The infrastructure constraints for the Urban TEP portal
captures the requirements for installation of the software element on its
base infrastructure. It specifies the basic installation requirements
for the component without consideration for its interaction
with other system components. Hence, satisfaction of the
Infrastructure Constraints specification does not imply proper
functional operation of the Tep Exploitation Platform.
