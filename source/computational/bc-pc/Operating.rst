   *Operating use cases*

Personnell
----------

The Urban TEP BC processing centre will be managed by the Calvalus operator with some Urban TEP-specific activities. 

 * An email account urbantep@brockmann-consult.de serves as communication endpoint.
 * The BC processing centre has an account in the Urban TEP portal issue tracking system.

Information persistence
-----------------------

Operators exchange information that is kept persistent:

 * The issue tracking keeps track of all communication activities regarding the BC processing centre. 
 * The record of emails keeps track of bilateral communication.
 * For private infomation a wiki document within the BC wiki (Confluence) is maintained. If necessary specific operational procedures inside the BC processing centre are documented here.

Service and functions
---------------------

Activities of the Operator comprise:

 * monitoring of ingestion
 * communication with data providers, configuration for new ingestion sources (new datasets, different extent, different time interval)
 * monitoring of processing, analysis of failures
 * support of users in case of issues assigned to the BC processing centre
 * support of well-known users for the integration and upload of processors (and reference datasets if necessary)
 * communication with the Portal Operating and with Operating of the other processing centres, exchange of datasets and processors
 * initiation and configuration for bulk processing in case of the systematic generation of a new product in the Urban TEP
 * initiation of reporting, verification of reports
 * data management, initiation of cleanup of old results

Interfaces and interface items
------------------------------

The external interfaces provided or used by Operating are:

 * The Operating provides an email interface
 * The Operating uses the issue tracking interface of the Portal
 * The Operating uses the online data access interfaces of other proessing centres (to exchange datasets or processors)

The internal interfaces within the BC processing centre used by Operating are:

 * The scripting and configuration interfaces of the Ingestion and Processing Control
 * HDFS and NFS interfaces of the HDFS EO Data and Processing Storage for data management, installation of processors, change of access rights
 * Versioning interface of Configuration and Processor Repository
 * NFS interface of Online Data Access for user support, exchange with other processing centres, and data management of the staging area
 * Monitoring and control interfaces, log files etc. of all components
