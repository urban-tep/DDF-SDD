:ref:`log4net <namespacelog4net>` Software Package

:ref:`log4net <namespacelog4net>` is a tool to help the programmer output log statements to a variety of output targets. In case of problems with an application, it is helpful to enable logging so that the problem can be located. With :ref:`log4net <namespacelog4net>` it is possible to enable logging at runtime without modifying the application binary. The :ref:`log4net <namespacelog4net>` package is designed so that log statements can remain in shipped code without incurring a high performance cost. It follows that the speed of logging (or rather not logging) is crucial.
