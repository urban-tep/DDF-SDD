The platform is meant to allow users to easily exploit EO data resources by combining fast data access, processing facilities and flexibility for the user's own data analysis. 
The platform provides Data Access, Data Processing Services and PaaS (Platform as a Service). 

* Data Access includes the possibility to perform catalogue queries. 
* Data Processing Services enable users to process data available in the repository using a number of well know tools and to exploit the results. 
* The PaaS enables users to perform their data exploitation activities with large flexibility and autonomy by using one or several virtual hosts directly provided on the infrastructure where the data resides. 

Users can therefore use their virtual hosts to efficiently access data and processing services, and immediately elaborate results by exploiting the analysis and visualization tools made available from the PaaS, or that they can directly install themselves in their virtual host. 
In addition, users can also open their own accounts on a commercial ICT Provider, and directly provision their virtual hosts independently (through the Urban TEP Platform Services).
