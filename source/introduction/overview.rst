-----------------

Section :ref:`context` provides a general description of the Urban TEP project context, highlighting the
main purposes, the role of the community and the target deliveries of the system.

Section :ref:`static_architecture` describes the first level decomposition that leads to a separation into
subsystems in a product-driven way.

Section :ref:`dynamic_architecture` covers the design of each subsystem, providing subsystems
computational model, components identification and description together with main data flow.

Section :ref:`integration_scheme` summarizes the integration scheme of the system as a whole.

Section :ref:`deployment_plan` provides the plan of the deployment of the subsystems on the infrastructure.

The design methods here used are the UML 2.0 :ref:`[RD4] <RD4>`, :ref:`[RD5] <RD5>`, :ref:`[RD6] <RD6>`, :ref:`[RD7] <RD7>`; all
diagrams and engineering notations intend to be compliant with standard there depicted.
