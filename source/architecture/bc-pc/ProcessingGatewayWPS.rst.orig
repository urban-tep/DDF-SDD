BC processing gateway/WPS
=========================

Implementation software and configuration
-----------------------------------------

The Processing Gateway and WPS is based on an Apache Tomcat and a WPS 1.0 implementation of BC. The Tomcat will be deployed on a virtual machine of the BC infrastructure in a protected network. It will be accessible via the Apache HTTP server at www.brockmann-consult.de that serves as a proxy.

The configuration specific for Urban TEP comprises:
 * the virtual machine *urbantep* hosting the Tomcat service
 * the rewrite rule of the Apache HTTP server for the context *https://www.brockmann-consult.de/urban-tep/*
 * the LDAP configuration of Tomcat to use the BC ldap for authentication of WPS and result access calls
 * the WPS configuration to allow users of the *urbantep* group to access the service
 * the WPS configuration to access the BC HDFS and YARN as backend, including retrival of datasets and processors configured for use by *urbantep* and storage area for result sets, reference data, and uploaded processor bundles
 * the allocation of the staging area for Urban TEP on the BC Online Data Access storage

State representation and persistent data
----------------------------------------

The Processing Gateway and WPS maintains a database of submitted and running asynchronous requests and their status. They are maintained in a HSQL database on the *urbantep* virtual machine.


Computational service and functions
-----------------------------------

The computational services of the Processing Gateway and WPS comprises implementations of the WPS functions GetCapabilities, DescribeProcess, Execute, and GetStatus. 
 * For GetCapabilities and DescribeProcess it determines all configured processors and datasets accessible by the user (of group *urbantep*) and caches this information for repeated use. The computational service for these functions is the conversion into the WPS-specific structure. 
 * For Execute it submits one or several requests to YARN according to the workflow used, and enters the request into the persistent local database. The conversion in this case is the other way round, e.g. to determine the input dataset from the input dataset name. It furhter monitors the status of the request and updates the database accordingly. 
 * For GetStatus it presents the status in the WPS structure.
 * For the retrieval of result datasets it stages the data at the Online Data Access and provides HTTP accesses the directories of the staging area.
 * For the upload of reference datasets and processor bundles it inserts the files into a user area of the HDFS EO Data and Processing Storage.

Interfaces and interface items
------------------------------

The external interfaces provided by the Processing Gateway/WPS are 
 * the WPS interface
 * the result access interface
 * the interface for upload of reference data and of processor bundles via HTTP
The subsystem-external interface used by the Processing Gateway/WPS is 
 * the catalogue interface of the Portal subsystem. 
Internally, the Processing Gateway/WPS uses 
 * the file system interface of the HDFS EO Data and Processing Storage
 * the job submission and monitoring interface of the YARN Scheduling and Processing component
 * the LDAP interface of the BC user management
 * the the file system interface of the Online Data Access
The internal interface of the Processing Gateway/WPS provided is
 * the plain Tomcat interface (logging, monitoring and control) for Operating

The OGC WPS interface items are defined in the OGC specification. Example interface items for Urban TEP are the following:
