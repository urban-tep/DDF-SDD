Processing Service Integration
==============================

The following section provides with the description of how a processing service is integrated in the platform.

Any registered user may use the help desk of the :ref:`portal` to get the technical specifications of the processing centres that are suitable for his envisioned processor along with the development kit for creating new processors. The selected processing centre will also provide specific experimental environment (e.g. a virtual machine image or connection information to the experimental infrastructure directly at the processing centre) with sample data for the user to test the processor during the development. The user will then have to build his software according to the specifications, validate it in the experimental environment and submit the software package via the help desk. Urban TEP help desk operator will manage deployment of the processor with the selected processing centre help desk and its integration to the `OGC Web Processing Service <http://www.opengeospatial.org/standards/wps>`_ on the processing centre and the portal.

The concepts of processor integration with frameworks and languages supported, packaging examples, and runtime environment are described for each respective processing centre, in section 4.5.7.4 and 4.6.3.3. Supported processor integration tools and languages are described in section 5.5 of the System and Service Technical Note. More detailed operational process for the processor deployment is described in section 4.1.4 of the Sustainable Operations Concept Technical Note.
