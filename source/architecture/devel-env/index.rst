Processor development environment
=================================

Urban TEP supports the integration of thematic urban data processors
with a development environment. The development environment shall
support the local test and the procedure of packaging and deployment
to a processing centre. The principle is that the development
environment as well as the target cluster infrastructure provide
common tools and frameworks already. Users install only their delta in
the development environment. They test the processor in this
environment, then package and deploy only their delta. The processing
centre provides the same tools and frameworks on the cluster
infrastructure and makes available the processor in the WPS.

The following figure depicts the approach.
